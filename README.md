Hello.

This is a simple slide show that was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For now it has all basic functions that are required. But in the future i'd like to add in more features to make it look good and make the JS even better.

Photo description:

Image_1 : This is an image of a plant in our house. It had some small weed growing in it and i thought it would look good from upclose. Turned out to be a good picture, so i thought i'd put it as the primary image in the slide show

Image_2 : This is a stress ball in a small plate on our balcony wall. I was trying to learn how aparture, or depth of field, works. The background is blurred out, due to low depth of field.

Image_3 : This is a picture of my brother and his friend(In the classic Titanic pose). I thought it was funny so i took a picture of it, and had to put it in the slide show cause..it's fun, haha!

Image_4 : This is probably the best out of the 4 images. The moon looked really good that day (it does everyday, but that day it looked way better) and i was able to get the shot, and it looks absolutely beautiful.

All the photos were taken using the Canon 200D MK-2.

I hope you liked the photos :)
